First challenge in my bootcamp
I've just finished making changes to the code to make it more accessible.

I reviewed and improved an existing website to meet accessibility criteria.
I added semantic elements like header, main, section, and footer.
I optimized images by adding alt attributes to enhance accessibility.
I updated the CSS to improve the site's design and readability.

here is my screenshots:
